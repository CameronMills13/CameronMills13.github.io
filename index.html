The reason I picked the section talking about software entropy and the broken window idea
is because it stuck out to me as something that I had never considered and was presented in
and intertersting manor. Obviously many of the projects that I have been on have been small
scale projects for classes. These projects don't normally last more than a week or two and 
have a manageable amount of parts. Still even on these projects I saw the negative affects
of a few broken windows on the project as a whole. One of the last projects I did for my 
Data Structures and Algorithms class, I thought I had done a section of the project 
correct from the beginning, but didn't bother to check to see if it was working. It ended
up not working correctly and took me close to six hours to diagnose the issue when I could
have just fixed the broken window origonally. 
I think that by being on top of software entroy and prioritizing commenting out bad code 
and fixing issues is a very important step towards having more sucessful projects. This 
idea not only stuck with me but so did the example they used of broken windows and how
it does have a real wworld affect on crime stistics and such. As I code more and more and 
have continued exposure to computer science I see the signs of psychological strain in those
around me and myself more and more. This idea and topic should help me aboid burnout or 
unneccesary stress.
